FileManager Simplest All-in-one (using PHP with CQRS)

**Installation and customization**

To install this file manager, you need to place it in any directory. 
**Note:** there are no access protection settings in this file, and all folders and files will be displayed publicly, so if you need to isolate access to a file, you will need to configure access to this file yourself on your web server.
